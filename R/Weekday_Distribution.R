ggplot2::ggplot#'Comparison of offices from different federal states regarding the number of reported cases on the different weekdays.
#'
#'\code{office_case_distribution()} is used to create a plot showing the mean number of reported cases in Germany regarding the specific weekdays
#'as well as the number of reported cases regarding the specific weekdays of the two given federal states. To see how fast or slow offices of different
#'federal states are reporting cases and how they differ to the mean number of reported cases overall.
#'All values are standardized.
#'
#'@param bundesland_1 A string of the desired federal state.
#'
#'@param bundesland_2 A string of the other desired federal state for the comparison.
#'
#'@return A plot that shows the standardized amount of cases that get reported per day in the given federal states
#'and the standardized amount of all reported cases per day.
