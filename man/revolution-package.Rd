\title{revolution: Analysis of COVID-19 Data in Germany}
\description{
The package "revolution" provides various tools of data analysis to inspect
    the course and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany over the span of more
    than a year. The package offers the possibility to retrieve the newest data directly
    from the German federal agency for disease control (RKI). It can be used to look at
    the trend of infections and deaths throughout
    the crisis, as well as analyze the circulation of the virus in certain demographic
    groups and compare the vulnerability to the virus of those groups. Furthermore,
    it can display the spread of the different virus mutations and the progress of the
    vaccination campaigns, starting at the end of 2020.

\details{
The core functions of the package include \code{get_data_for()},
\code{get_sti_series_for()}, \code{get_vaccination_data()}, \code{variant_case_time_series()}
and \code{plot_excess_mortality()} with their respective plot functions for
visualisation.

The functions can roughly be divided into 2 categories: Plot functions, and generators
of time series.

Plot functions look at a certain aspact of the COVID-19 pandemic, may it be vaccinations, variants,
exess deaths, seven day incidences for different regions, and much more.

Generator functions generate the underlaying data which is to be plotted. These functions are usefull
if the user wants to build tools ontop of the data.

The package uses a lot of external data. The main data set is the RKI COVED-19 data API, which
can be found under \url{https://npgeo-corona-npgeo-de.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/dd4580c810204019a7b8eb3e0b329dd6_0/about}
In addition the package draws on vaccination data aquired via \url{https://impfdashboard.de/daten} provided
by the Paul Ehrlich Institute, and variants of concern data provided by the RKI. Since all these data sets
have to be updated to understand the current stage of the pandemic, the package provides an update function
for each of these data sets (\code{update_rki_data()},\code{update_vac_data()}, and \code{update_voc_data()}).
Please refere to the documentation of these functions, since especially the RKI data set is rather large.

Other data used in the package includes economic data, as well as mobility data. These are further explained
in their respective documentation (of the functions calling on them).

but was modified to fit our purposes.
